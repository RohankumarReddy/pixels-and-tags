# Day 05 â€“ Getting better at Flexbox and Grid

## âœ… What I Did
- I was not confident with what I learned regarding flexbox and grid.
- Practiced these concepts again by making clones of some easy looking websites
- I'll be cloning Amazon's websites after a day or two after completing some easy projects.

## ðŸ’¡ Thoughts
feeling great after understanding stuff to the core.Quite excited about Amazon's cloning project!!!

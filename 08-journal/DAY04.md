# Day 04 â€“ Flexbox and Grid

## âœ… What I Did
-Started with Flexbox and yeah, this is way better than the way I was using CSS before knowing this.
-Grid was also cool where I can make divisions easily using rows and columns method.
-Byfar the best way to style <div> and increase productivity!

## ðŸ’¡ Thoughts
I want to be good at it so , i'll be doing some projects(small) to build my confidence to move further.
